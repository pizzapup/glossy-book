// > "Your design decisions shouldn’t be the reason a user can’t access content on a page" [Elise Blanchard - blog.mozilla.org](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/internet-culture/deep-dives/why-are-hyperlinks-blue/#:~:text=on%20a%20page.-,Interactive%20states,-should%20always%20be)

// Usage/Functional Patterns:

// - Navigation Links - used to navigate to another page or window. (If a link navigates to an external site, put the URL in the infotip so that users can determine the target of the link)
// - Task Links - used to initiate a new command. Use for commands that aren't destructive or are easily reversible. Commands that display a dialog box or a confirmation are a good choices for task links.
// - Help Links - text link used to display a Help topic
// - Definition Links - text link used to display a definition in an infotip when the user clicks on or hovers over the link
// - Menu Links - set of task links used to create a menu
// - Option Links - selected option or its placeholder, where clicking the link invokes a command to change that option

// Presentation Patterns:

// - Plain text links - consist only of text
// - Text with icon links - text with a preceding icon that indicates its function (typically uses 16x16 pixel icon). The icon needs to lead into the text visually
// - \*\* Graphics-only links - consist only of a graphic (note: due to their potential recognition and localization problems, graphics-only links are not recommended as the only way to perform a task)

// Interaction:

// - Display a busy pointer if the result of clicking a link isn't instantaneous. Without feedback, users might assume that the click didn't happen and click again

// Link States:

// - visited
// - unvisited
// - hover
// - focus
// - active

// - Skip Links - mechanism that enables users to navigate directly to content or navigation on entering any given page. may be positioned off-screen initially but must be available to screen reader users and must be visible on focus for sighted keyboard navigators. [wordpress.org](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/required/#3-accessibility)
// minimally conforming skip link must:
// - Be the first focusable element perceived by a user via a screen reader or keyboard navigation
// - Be visible when keyboard focus moves to the link
// - Move focus to the main content area of the page when activated
// - _This only applies if there is something to skip past, such as a menu or larger header section or secondary widget area before the main content_

// ## Accessibility Info

// Making Links Recognizable:

// > "users must be able to recognize links by visual inspection alone they shouldn't have to hover over an object or click it to determine if it is a link" - [from Windows App Development: Links/Design Concepts by Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/uxguide/ctrl-links?redirectedfrom=MSDN#design_concepts:~:text=users%20must%20be%20able%20to%20recognize%20links%20by%20visual%20inspection%20alone%20they%20shouldn%27t%20have%20to%20hover%20over%20an%20object%20or%20click%20it%20to%20determine%20if%20it%20is%20a%20link)

// Notes on Underlining:

// - [When to underline a link?](https://www.a11y-collective.com/the-perfect-link/#:~:text=When%20to%20underline%20a%20link%3F)
// - "By default, browsers underline links to let the user know what is clickable. Some designers use CSS to turn off underlines for hyperlinks. This causes usability and accessibility problems, as it makes it more difficult to identify hyperlinks from the surrounding text" [Wordpress.org](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/ui-best-practices/#style-links-with-underlines)
// - For links that are necessary to perform a primary task, provide visual clues so that users can recognize links by visual inspection alone. These clues include underlining, graphics or bullets, and standard link locations. Users shouldn't have to hover over an object or attempt to click on it to determine if it is a link. Use underlined text if the link isn't obvious from its context.

// - Reserve underlining only for links. Use italics where you'd otherwise use underlined text
// - When printing, don't print underlines or link colors.
// - If you are considering removing underlines from links [this article by Adrian Roselli on link underlines](https://adrianroselli.com/2016/06/on-link-underlines.html#styling) contains some good info

// The technique [G201](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G201.html) of the WCAG asks that each link opens in a new tab has:

// - a warning spoken in assistive technology that this link opens to a new tab,
// - a visual warning in text that this link opens to a new window.

// ## Native Markup Limitations for Links:

// - an `<a>` element _is_ interactive and cannot contain any interactive descendants

// ### Nested ['Layered'](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/nested-links/) Links:

// Getting the title of the post to expand and cover the entire post area would mean that that area would also link to the post, which is exactly what we want to do in the first place!

// .the-post {
// /_ elevate the links up _/
// a {
// position: relative;
// z-index: 1;
// }
// }

// .the-post-title {
// /_ ... _/

// a {
// position: static;
// /_ expand the pseudo-element to cover the post area _/
// &::before {
// content: "";
// position: absolute;
// z-index: 0;
// top: ...;
// left: ...;
// width: ...;
// height: ...;
// /_ ... _/
// }
// }
// }

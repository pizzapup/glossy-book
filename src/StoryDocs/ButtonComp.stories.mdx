# Buttons

aria-pressed='true'/'false' needed

can use type='button' instead of event.preventDefault()

never change pressed state and label together; if a label changes, a change in state is already communicated

- `input` that allows for use-triggered actions when clicked or pressed (related: link)
- standardizing the appearance of buttons in your application enhances the user's recognition of the widgets as buttons
- Buttons support the optional attribute aria-pressed
- Buttons with a non-empty aria-pressed attribute are toggle buttons. When aria-pressed is true the button is in a "pressed" state, when aria-pressed is false it is not pressed.
- If the attribute is not present, the button is a simple command button
